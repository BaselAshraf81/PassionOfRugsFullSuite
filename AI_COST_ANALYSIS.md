## Detailed Cost Breakdown (GPT-5 nano)

### Address Correction
**Typical token usage:**
- Input: ~500 tokens (address data + prompt)
- Output: ~200 tokens (corrected address + reasoning)

**Cost calculation:**
- Input: 500 Ã— $0.050 / 1,000,000 = $0.000025
- Output: 200 Ã— $0.400 / 1,000,000 = $0.000080
- **Total per correction: $0.000105 (~$0.0001)**

### Person Filtering
**Typical token usage:**
- Input: ~2000 tokens (original data + API responses + prompt)
- Output: ~800 tokens (filtered results + insights)

**Cost calculation:**
- Input: 2000 Ã— $0.050 / 1,000,000 = $0.000100
- Output: 800 Ã— $0.400 / 1,000,000 = $0.000320
- **Total per person: $0.000420 (~$0.0004)**

### Combined Cost Per Person
- Address correction (30% of people): $0.0001 Ã— 0.30 = $0.00003
- Person filtering (100% of people): $0.0004 Ã— 1.00 = $0.00040
- **Average total per person: $0.00043 (~$0.0005)**

## Volume Pricing

| Volume | Address Corrections | Person Filtering | Total Cost |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| 100 people | $0.003 | $0.042 | **$0.045** |
| 500 people | $0.015 | $0.210 | **$0.225** |
| 1,000 people | $0.030 | $0.420 | **$0.450** |
| 5,000 people | $0.150 | $2.100 | **$2.250** |
| 10,000 people | $0.300 | $4.200 | **$4.500** |

*Assuming 30% need address correction

## Cost Comparison: Before vs After

### Previous Estimate (GPT-4o-mini - no longer available)
- Per person: ~$0.001 (0.1 cents)
- 1000 people: ~$1.00

### Current Pricing (GPT-5 nano)

Only enable AI for:
- Addresses that fail initial lookup (reactive, not proactive)
- Complex cases with multiple residents
- High-value leads

**Potential savings:** 50-70%

### 2. Caching
- Cache AI corrections for similar addresses
- Reuse person filtering results
- Store successful patterns

**Potential savings:** 20-40%

### 3. Batch Processing
- Process multiple people in one session
- Reduce API overhead
- Optimize token usage

**Potential savings:** 10-20%

### 4. Model Selection
Switch models based on complexity:
- Simple cases: GPT-5 nano ($0.0005/person)
- Complex cases: GPT-4.1 nano ($0.0010/person)
- Critical cases: GPT-4.1 mini ($0.0040/person)

**Potential savings:** 30-50% on average
